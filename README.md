# Emotion_recognition_system
We have designed a "Facial Emotion Recognition Systems using Image Anlaysis through Deep Learning to automatically identify and categorise human emotions from image data inputs. This systems leverage deep learning techniques, which involve neural networks with multiple layers that can learn and extract complex features from raw data. In this model we have used FER-2013 dataset which is a collection of 7 different emotions comprising of total 35,887 grayscale images each of size 48x48 pixels.

For recognising these emotions and emotional states from images, we have to detect, evaluate and interpret these images. By leveraging deep learning models line CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and transfer learning, our emotion recognition systems achieved an accuracy of 70.26% on training dataset and 57.18% accuracy on testing dataset And is able to detect the emotions, offering insightful information in a variety of disciplines, improving the responsiveness and intuitiveness of interactions.
